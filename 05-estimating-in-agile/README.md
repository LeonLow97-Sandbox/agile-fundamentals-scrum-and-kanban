# Estimating in Agile

## Introduction to Estimating 

- How long does it take to complete a user story?
    - developed, tested and ready to be released.
    - educated guess
- Used to estimate
    - elicited information: gathered from stakeholders (estimate how long it is going to take)
    - past experiences (other user stories in the past that are similar to this)
    - documentation (standard documents from organization)

## Why Estimate?

- Provides estimated duration
- Drives out clarification questions
    - allows the developer to read the acceptance criteria properly
- Highlights complex and high risk tasks

## Estimation Techniques

### Big / Uncertain / Small (BUS)

- Categorized into groupings
    - Big, Uncertain, Small
- Each user story is compared to others and assigned to a group
    - 'Big' stories should be broken up if possible (easier to work with smaller user stories)
    - 'Uncertain' stories need to be groomed or broken up

### T-Shirt Sizes

- Categorized into typical t-shirt sizes
    - XS, S, M, L, XL
- Each user story is compared to others and assigned a t-shirt size
    - Larger stories should be broken up if possible.

### Fibonacci Sequence

- Abstract value to represent size
    - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
- Each user story is compared to othes and assigned "Story Points"
    - Larger stories should be broken up if possible
    - Story points estimate is the numeric value representing the **effort** needed to complete a user story assigned by the Scrum Team.
- Number of points per sprint is the team's velocity
