# What is Agile?

## 4 Values

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
   - Value people and interactions among people.
   - People interacting with team members and businesses/stakeholders.
1. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
   - Main deliverable is the software.
   - Create learning and shared understanding (among team members and stakeholders) through working software.
1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
   - Collaborate and delight customers.
   - However, we want to change the way we write our contract.
   - Rather than putting customer in a strong contract on day 1, work with the client throughout the project.
1. Responding to change over following a plan.
   - Being ready for changes and responding to any changes.

## 12 Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
   - deliver value faster (maybe weekly) to the customer and they can give you feedback, rather than giving all the value at the end.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processed harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
   - responding to customer's needs when change is required in agile processed.
1. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the **shorter timescale**.
   - "working software": a part of the feature that works and pass to customer to receive feedback.
1. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
   - collaboration (helps everyone get on the same pace)
   - has anything changed?
1. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
   - teams are cross-functional.
1. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
   - instead of passing a big documentation to the developer, communicate what you need instead.
1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
   - What have you built? Purely working software.
   - Not how much analysis you have done or how many pages of documentation you have created.
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
   - think about quality, evolve the features to drive value later on.
   - if you have problems in early design, will face issues in the long run.
1. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
   - just because you have many features, does not make it better.
1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
   - every team member has different learning experiences or different challenges, share with the team so everyone can learn from one another.

## Top 5 Agile Principles

1. Deliver value faster
1. Welcome change
   - regardless of where you are in the project, can make adjustments.
1. Work together daily
1. Working software is key
   - customer can give feedback on the software.
1. Reflect and adjust
   - regular share learning experiences.
   - retrospective

## Benefits of using Agile

- Deliver value in smaller increments to customers. Can gain critical feedback (they like it or don't like it).
  - Solve a lot of smaller problems before they become a big issue
- Project team can understand what they could have done differently to become more successful.

## Challenges of using Agile

- Agile changes the whole mindset of the company.
- The way people and teams work with each other.
- Agile focuses more on communication than documentation.
- In traditional waterfall, you document features and can implement in the next project. In agile, it is difficult to apply the previous feature into a new project because it is not documented.

# Scrum Methodology

## Scrum Overview

- Lightweight framework designed to solve complex problems that required sprinting or iterating through a solution.
- Inspection, Adaption and Transparency.
- Sprint (anywhere from 1-4 weeks)
  - get it production-ready by the end of the sprint for customer.
  - Planning, developing, testing and reviewing of a working unit of software is completed with this time box.
- Scrum is an Agile way of developing software of any project.
- Scrum is more of a framework than a methodology or process.
- Scrum recommends a self-organizing and cross-functional team.
- If there is a challenge or a conflict in the team, they come together and discuss and decide on a own way to move forward as a team.
