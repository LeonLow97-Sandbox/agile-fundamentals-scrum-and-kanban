## What is the waterfall methodology?

- Sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, development, and testing) with **each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins**.
- The success of the Waterfall method depends on the **amount and quality of the work done on the front end**, **documenting everything in advance**, including the user interface, user stories and all the features' variations and outcomes.
- With a Waterfall project, if parameters change along the way, it's **harder to change course** than it is with Agile methodology.
- Individual execution teams are **not required to be in constant communication** and, unless specific integrations are required, are usually self-contained.
- Team members also tend to **work independently** and are not expected to provide status reports as often as with the Agile approach. Usually, one phase does not begin until the previous one is finished.

## 5 Common Stages in the Waterfall process

1. Requirements
    - Assumes that all project requirements can be gathered and understood upfront.
    - The project manager does their best to get a detailed understanding of the project sponsor's requirements.
    - Written requirements, usually contained in single document, are used to describe each stage of the project, including the costs, assumptions, risks, dependencies, success metrics and timelines for completion.
2. Design
    - Software developers design a technical solution to the problems set out by the product requirements, including scenarios, layouts and data models.
    - First, a higher-level or logical design is created that describes the **purpose and scope of the project**, the general traffic flow of each components, and the integration points.
    - Once this is complete, it is transformed into a **physical design using specific hardware and software technologies**.
3. Implementation
    - Shortest phase of the Waterfall process because painstaking research and design have already been done.
    - In this phase, programemrs code applications based on project requirements and specifications, with some testing and implementation taking place as well. 
    - If significant changes are required during this stage, this may mean going back to the design phase.
4. Verification or testing
    - Before a product can be released to customers, testing needs to be done to ensure that the product has no errors and all of the requirements have been completed, ensuring a good user experience with the software. 
    - The testing team will turn to the design documents, personas and user case scenarios supplied by the product manager to create their test cases.
5. Deployment and maintenance
    - Once the software has been deployed in the market or released to customers, the maintenance phase begins. 
    - As defects are found and change requests come in from users, a team will be assigned to take care of updates and release new versions of the software.

## Advantages of the Waterfall methodology

- Developers can catch design errors during the analysis and design stages, helping them to avoid writing faulty code during the implementation phase.
- The total cost of the project can be accurately estimated, as can the timeline, after the requirements have been defined.
- With the structured approach, it is easier to measure progress according to clearly defined milestones.
- Developers who join the project in progress can easily get up to speed because everything they need to know should be in the requirements document.
- Customers aren’t always adding new requirements to the project, delaying production.

## Disadvantages of the Waterfall methodology

- Projects can take longer to deliver with this chronological approach than with an iterative one, such as the Agile method.
- Clients often don’t fully know what they want at the front end, opening the door to requests for changes and new features later in the process when they’re harder to accommodate.
- Clients are not involved in the design and implementation stages.
- Deadline creep—when one phase in the process is delayed, all the other phases are delayed.

## Who uses the Waterfall model?

- No ambiguous requirements
- Offer a clear picture of how things will proceed from the outset.
- Have clients who seem unlikely to change the scope of the project once it is underway.

## Difference between the Waterfall and Agile approaches to project management

- While the Waterfall model relies on thorough up-front planning in which each phase must be fully completed before the next one starts, Agile is a more flexible, iterative process that tackles the planning, design, implementation, and testing tasks in shorter, repeating cycles.
- With Waterfall, the customer doesn’t usually play a hands-on role once their requirements have been collected. With Agile, the customer has greater input throughout development. 
- Instead of having Waterfall milestones, Agile works in “sprints,” where prioritized tasks are completed in short windows of time, such as two weeks.
